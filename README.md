You liked PacMan, you're definetely gonna love *PacMine*! 😍 PacMine is just like the all-time-favourite PacMan, but you can now leave MINES behind you as go! This is perfect to capture the Ghosts and make them run back to their spawn zone. You get TONS of bombs in each level; Use strategies to plant them in the perfect spots and score more on each explosition. It's like you're psychic, predicting their every move! Get ready to bomb the things you hate!!

Just like PacMan the rules of the game are simple; 
1. You are left with ghosts in a maze filled with coins. Your goal is to collect as many coins as possible. You level up when the whole maze is completed. In your way try to get as much fruits as you can.
2. You start with 3 lives and they replenish as you level up.
3. Stay as away as you can from the Ghosts. 

Bomb Rule:
1. While you're running you get to drop mines using the ``space`` key. 
2. You are IMMUNE to your own mines, but they kill the ghosts on impact.
3. It's your goal to determine the ghosts' move so they get caught as many times.
4. You get 5 mines in the beginning. They fill up again every level.

### Most Important Rule of All: DON'T DIE

In PacMine, understanding the behavior of ghosts is key to your strategy. The ghosts move in predictable patterns, which is your biggest advantage. Here's a breakdown of how the game works:

#### Ghost Movement Patterns:
**Blinky**, **Pinky**, **Inky** and **Clyde**, collectively known as the Ghost Gang. They move in their own unique ways. These patterns can be figured out and used to your advantage. This comes with practice. Here are some hints
1. **Red Ghosts**: Will follow you and move towards your position directly, so lead it into a trap with a well-placed mine.
2. **Pink Ghost**: Predicts your next move and cuts you off at the worst moment. Avoid being too predictable.
3. **Blue Ghost**: Plans it moves based on how close you are to the Red Ghost. Use it to trick it into corners where it's easy to catch
4. **Orange Ghost**: Hardest one to guess. It moves in unpredictable patterns. Stay aware of its moves and place mines where it frequently moves.


#### Mines and Traps
1. Plant your mines in tight spots like hallways or corners. Ghosts like to hang out there, so you'll catch 'em easy! 
2. You can even trick them by moving in patterns they follow, then slipping away through tunnels or corners. 
3. Just remember, mines are powerful but not endless, so use them wisely to catch as many ghosts as you can!


#### Power-ups and Scoring
1. **Fruits**: Collect as many fruits as you can. They give you extra points.
2. **Coints**: Your main objective should be to collect all coins. After you're done collecting points, you level up.
3. **Bombs**: Bombs not only slow down the Ghosts, you score points.

**PacMine** is a fork of the implementation of freepacman.org. I made changes to the game to add the mine mechanism. \
The **original game** is freely available on [freepacman.org](https://freepacman.org/). 

**PacMan** itself is an old arcade game developed by Namco. I also credit Shigeo Funaki, Shigeichi Ishimura, and various other producers, developers and publishers for their overarching contributing in developing the masterpiece.

For more details, you can view my changes as commits to this [repo](https://github.com/yashjha123/PacMine).
